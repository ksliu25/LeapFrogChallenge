# LeapFrogChallenge
LeapFrog's code challenge

## Gems/packages
This makes use of the native net/http library along with native json library. For testing, http responses were stubbed using webmock.

## Testing
To test this challenge you will need to pulldown the repo and either bundle install or install the webmock gem manually.
<pre><code> bundle install </code></pre>
or
<pre><code>gem install webmock</code></pre>

Then simply run rspec spec in the root directory to run the tests.
